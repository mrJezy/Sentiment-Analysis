# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis of political tweets from Hungary

There were a couple of contradictory [political events](http://www.france24.com/en/20170410-hungary-president-signs-law-threatening-soros-university) in Hungary lately and the below code tries to capture the reaction of the public by applying sentiment analysis on tweets from Twitter using 2 search words:  

1. 'Viktor Orb√°n' - the current prime minister of Hungary
2. \#istandwithCEU - the most used supporting hashtag of the Central European University

The tweets used in this project are from 1st until 14th April 2017.

######*NOTE: The project doesn't want to take a stand on or against any political sides, it only shows an example of how to use R as a data science tool to do a sentiment analysis. Therefore the results will not be discussed.*
